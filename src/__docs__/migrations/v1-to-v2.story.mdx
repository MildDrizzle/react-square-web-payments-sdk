# Migrating from v1 to v3

To be honest with all of you, the migration process will be easy. The new version introduces a lot of breaking changes especially on the rendering of payment methods.

**Here are the major changes:**

### 1. [`methodsSupported` property in the context is confusing #11](https://github.com/weareseeed/react-square-web-payments-sdk/issues/11)

With this change you don't need to pass the methodsSupported property anymore.

Before:

```tsx
<SquarePaymentsForm
  {...props}
  methodsSupported={{ applePay: true, card: true }}
>
  <ApplePay />
  <CreditCardInput />
</SquarePaymentsForm>
```

After:

```tsx
<SquarePaymentsForm {...props}>
  <ApplePay />
  <CreditCardInput />
</SquarePaymentsForm>
```

### 2. [Remove suffix `Button` from payment methods #13](https://github.com/weareseeed/react-square-web-payments-sdk/issues/13)

With this change you don't need to pass the suffix `Button` anymore when calling a digital wallet.

Before:

```tsx
<ApplePayButton />
<GooglePayButton />
```

After:

```tsx
<ApplePay />
<GooglePay />
```

### 3. [Add event listeners to `CreditCardInput` #14](https://github.com/weareseeed/react-square-web-payments-sdk/issues/14)

With this issue we added event listeners to `CreditCardInput` to be able to handle all the events from Square, such as:

- `cardBrandChanged`
- `errorClassAdded`
- `errorClassRemoved`
- `focusClassAdded`
- `focusClassRemoved`
- `postalCodeChanged`
- `scape`
- `submit`
- And last but not less, we introduce the `recalculateSize` this function helps when we need to make the form responsive but is not doing it, so we can call the function and Web Payments SDK going to know the width to resize

### 4. [SCA is not working as intended #15](https://github.com/weareseeed/react-square-web-payments-sdk/issues/15)

On the v1 the Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) was not working as intended, so we introduced a new props for the function `cardTokenizeResponseReceived`, this function is called when the response from the payments is received and it's going to be used to retrieve the verification token and nonce of the payment method.

Before:

```tsx
<SquarePaymentsForm
  {...props}
  cardTokenizeResponseReceived={(token) => {
    console.info(token);
  }}
>
  <ApplePayButton />
  <CreditCardInput />
</SquarePaymentsForm>
```

After:

```tsx
<SquarePaymentsForm
  {...props}
  cardTokenizeResponseReceived={(token, verifiedBuyer) => {
    // The verifiedBuyer is the object that contains the verification token
    console.info(token, verifiedBuyer);
  }}
>
  <ApplePay />
  <CreditCardInput />
</SquarePaymentsForm>
```

### 5. [Pay Button active while waiting for `cardTokenizeResponseReceived` #3](https://github.com/weareseeed/react-square-web-payments-sdk/issues/3)

To improve the UX we added a new prop inside the payment buttons to show the user that the payment is being processed or the method is loading.

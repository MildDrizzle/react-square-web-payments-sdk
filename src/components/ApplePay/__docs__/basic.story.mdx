## Prerequisites and assumptions

- You are using HTTPS and have a Square account. Apple Pay payments cannot be tested with HTTP or from localhost.
- You use the payment form in a Safari browser that is:
  - **iOS 10 and later.** Apple Pay JavaScript is supported on all iOS devices with a Secure Element. It is supported in both Safari and [SFSafariViewController](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller) objects.
  - **macOS 10.12 and later.** Apple Pay JavaScript is supported in Safari. The user must have an iPhone or Apple Watch to authorize the payment or have a MacBook Pro with Touch ID.

For a better walktrhough of the steps, please refer to [Tale an Apple Pay Payment](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/web-payments/apple-pay#step-1-register-your-sandbox-domain-with-apple) on the Square Developer docs.

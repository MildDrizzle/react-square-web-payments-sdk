# recalculateSize()

Recalculates the size of the card form.

The Card component normally automatically resizes based on the size of the buyer's browser,
however if the Card component is contained with an element that has a computed style property
of "display: none", then the Card component will no longer have a defined width and therefore
will not properly resize between mobile and desktop configurations. Upon being displayed again,
the Card component will not automatically update its size to match the browser `window`.

This method `recalculateSize()` can be used to handle this edge case by forcing the Card
component to recalculate its size and display appropriately for mobile or desktop.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="BasicExample" story={Example} />
</Canvas>

```tsx
// Props is just and example of how to pass in props, you will need to pass in your own props
<SquarePaymentsForm {...props}>
  <CreditCardInput
    recalculateSize={(callResize) => {
      // We can call the `callResize` function to force the Card component to recalculate its size
      callResize();

      // Also we can called conditionally
      if (window.innerWidth > 768) {
        callResize();
      }
    }}
  />
</SquarePaymentsForm>
```
